## Hey there, I’m Vivek! 🤓

I'm a Product Manager passionate about creating products that users love. I bring ideas to life with products.


### About me 👋

* I currently live in Bangalore, India 🇮🇳
* I've built [Hevo Data Inc](https://hevodata.com/) along with [other passionate folks](https://hevodata.com/team/). We can talk more about the journey of zero to one.
* I try to become a better version of myself by reading non-fiction and experimenting with the learnings in my life.
* I'm also an avid trekker and traveler. I have solo traveled to almost all parts of India. Hitchhiking and meeting people from a different culture is something that I like the most. You can follow my travels on [Instagram](https://bit.ly/instagram-vivek). The above view from 12500ft is the best view I've ever seen. 
* I sometimes [tweet](https://bit.ly/Twitter-vivek) on product management and life learnings.


#### My path to Product Manager ✨

* I'm a product geek with an engineering degree in the field of Computer Science from [NIT Durgapur, India](https://nitdgp.ac.in/).
* The world of coding opened up a whole new dimension for me. I have been coding for the first 5 years of my professional career.
* Being the Founding Engineer at [Hevo Data Inc](https://hevodata.com/), I've contributed to all the code modules to empower the platform. I also took part in building the product roadmap, hiring the best team possible, building a world-class culture, and also a product that customers love. This diverse interest in everything around the product led me to become a Product Manager. I currently oversee everything that is being built at Hevo with the help of my team.
* You can know more about my professional journey on [LinkedIn](bit.ly/linkedIn-vivek)


#### What gets me out of bed in the morning 🌞

My favorite things to do are learning about this world, acquiring new skills, and making things. It’s an added bonus if I can do it with a community of like-minded people. A lot of time I hang out online with them on Lunchclub or Clubhouse.

Some of the things you can find me doing when I’m not building Hevo:

* Experimenting with Coffee
* Sweating profusely in a CrossFit
* Cooking white sauce pasta or Indian
* DIY-ing beautiful things for my new home
* Reading books about product building, design, finance, psychology, philosophy, or extraordinary people
* Having long and weird conversations with friends
* Traveling to new places
* Attending hackathons or conferences
* Taking courses and learning new things


#### How I work 💪

I’m a huge believer in [deep work](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/). Nothing meaningful can be created without flow. All of my work practices are aimed towards maximizing deep work and minimizing any distractions (meetings, I’m looking at you 👀 ). 

* I try to attend the least amount of meetings possible. 
* I put a lot of effort into my written communication to minimize the need for synchronous meetings.
* I use a Pomodoro timer to help me stay focused on one task at a time.
* I spend a lot of time learning new things and increasing my efficiency, so I can accomplish more in less time.
* I don't store a lot of data in my small head 😛 instead I use notebooks. 


#### How to reach me 📫

* **E-mail:**  I read my emails once a day. You should not feel obligated to read or respond to any of the emails you receive from me outside of your normal hours. You can reach out to me at wvsinha [at] gmail [dot] com
* By default, you should be able to schedule a [30 minute 1:1s](https://calendly.com/sinhavivek) with me as needed. I prefer that you schedule the meeting, just don't make it too late. 


#### Ask me about 💬
* Coffee ☕️
* Life, mountains, and philosophy ⽣
* Building a SaaS product from the ground up ⨳


#### My learnings 📕
* You can follow my bookshelves on [goodreads](https://bit.ly/goodreads-vivek).
* I follow a few blogs and newsletters, one of the bests is [Timeless insights for life and business](https://fs.blog/).
* I'm currently learning how to play guitar. 🎸


#### Trivia ⏳
* Good music, a cup of coffee, and mountains make a nice combination, is what I believe in. 
* Living in mountains for months do create stories, I have got a lot of them to tell. Some of them include my hitchhiking experience and escape from a near-death accident while traveling solo in the Himalayas. 🏔
* My pose in the above photo is me welcoming anything that the universe has for me.
* Music is attached to my sole. [Led Zeppelin](https://open.spotify.com/artist/36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp?si=7Ri6ip7JRcqmc_RDjT1LWg&dl_branch=1), [Parvaaz](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6vwSAnfnlO6Sy37KubGrLh?si=Pt278W9fTZm7zCLLtPINpA&dl_branch=1) or [Pink Floyd](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9?si=MQb6WeGcRpGCNPtrK9MYRA&dl_branch=1) always tops my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/vivekwiki) year wrap.
* Political drama or thriller on Netflix is my guilty pleasure. I can binge straight for 10-12 hours. 📺
* I forget a lot of things 🤯 just kidding, I forgot an important day once.
* In an interview, I answered the name of my book would be "Zero to One in Life." I think it was either quite geeky or cheesy. :P
